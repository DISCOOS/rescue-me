## How does it work? {.lead}

We locate smartphones with an **4-step process**. First, the system sends a SMS to the smartphone.
The SMS ask the user to click on a link embedded in the message. If the user choose to do so, the smartphone opens
the browser and starts downloading a page carefully designed for fast localization. In normal circumstances, it should
take much less than a second to download and open the page. Typically 0.2 seconds on
[2G networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2G) (edge). The page is optimized balancing between fast download (small size)
and make it fault-tolerant enough to handle well-known compatibility problems, and user-friendly enough to ensure users
respond appropriately to situations which require user actions (turn on network connection, GPS and data roaming).
