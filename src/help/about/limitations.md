## Limitations {.lead}

<span class="text-error">**No tool is perfect**</span>. {{TITLE}} has real life limitations which operators have to
recognize and understand. First of all, **there is no magic involved**. No covert, secret or special technologies are used,
only open standards. Secondly, **the smartphone must be turned on**. It might seem trivial, but an empty battery breaks
everything. This requirement is impossible for us to overcome. Only the person carrying a smartphone can solve this one.
More significantly, **smartphones must have network- and data coverage**. This is probably the second hardest requirement
to overcome. Much effort and consideration has been is put into the design to reduce the impact. {{TITLE}} is able to
work with the lowest possible coverage. It is however impossible to overcome altogether. *No network, no position. It`s
that simple*. Only **smartphones with a GPS receiver** is possible to locate with high accuracy, and it have to be turned
on. If a GPS is not available, or it is not able get a location fix, you are at best going to receive a course location.
Course locations are based on information from the network or mobile operating system, or just the last known location.
A course location have limited value, but are not worthless. They can still be used to narrow down a search to great
extent. The **last limitation is privacy**. Users, governments, standardization bodies and ultimately smartphone
manufactures care about privacy. {{TITLE}} have to comply with the rules for user consent and location sharing. If a
user does not want to share the location, {{TITLE}} have to comply.
